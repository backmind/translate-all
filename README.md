A small module for FoundryVTT that allows you to translate:
- Spells  
- Items  
- Abilities  
- Journal Entries  

into your specified language.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Visit [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Get your API key: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)  
   - ⚠️ **Important:** The key will only be shown once. Copy it and store it somewhere safe.  
   - Set a **spending limit**. I'm using `o4-mini`, which is very affordable. Still, set a budget — I'm not responsible for any charges.  
   - You'll get a free trial with some usage credits.  
   - Costs are generally low and depend on how many words you translate. Check [OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/pricing).
3. Enter the API key in the FoundryVTT module settings. The key is stored in your browser rather than in the world, so your players never receive it. Enter it again if you run Foundry from a different browser, and each GM uses their own.
4. You're ready to Translate ALL!

## Custom API Endpoints (OpenAI-compatible)

The **API Endpoint** setting lets you point the module at any OpenAI-compatible backend (Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, a corporate proxy). The default is `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

Things to know before using a custom endpoint:

- **Requests are made from the browser**, not from the Foundry server. Whoever clicks Translate must be able to reach the endpoint from their machine.
- **Mixed content**: if your Foundry instance is served over `https://`, browsers will block requests to an `http://` endpoint. Serve the endpoint over HTTPS or put it behind a reverse proxy.
- **API key storage**: the key is stored per browser (client-scoped) rather than in the world, so it is never sent to your players. Each GM enters their own key, and a browser without the key cannot translate.
- **CORS**: browser-origin fetches require the endpoint to allow your Foundry origin. For self-hosted backends (e.g. Ollama), set the equivalent of `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` or the specific origin.
- The model dropdown is populated by querying `<endpoint>/models` when the world loads. After changing the endpoint or the key, press the refresh button next to the **Target Model** dropdown to reload the list without restarting the world.
- Custom endpoints are not guaranteed to work: compatibility with third-party backends is the user's responsibility.

## How It Works

A new **"Translate"** button will appear in the header of the sheet where the document is edited:  
![Before translation](./images/before_translation.png)

For a journal page, open the page for editing first: the button is in the page editor, not in the page as you read it. Whatever the editor currently holds is what gets translated, including edits you have not saved yet.

After clicking it, a spinner will appear. Wait for it to finish:  
![After translation](./images/during_translation.png)

The page will automatically close when finished, and the translation should be in place.

## Experimental: Read-Aloud Text-to-Speech (PF2E only)

For the **Pathfinder 2e** system, the module can also synthesize the boxed read-aloud passages (`<p class="read-aloud">`) into spoken audio using OpenAI's TTS API, and save them as MP3 files inside your Foundry Data folder so they can be replayed instantly by any client.

Before enabling the feature, paragraphs look like this:

![Read-aloud paragraph without TTS buttons](./images/before_tts.png)

Once enabled, two small buttons appear next to each paragraph:

![Read-aloud paragraph with Generate and Play buttons](./images/after_tts.png)

- **Generate** (download icon) — calls the TTS API and saves the resulting MP3 to `Data/translateAll/textToSpeech/<hash>.mp3`. Becomes a *regenerate* icon once an audio file exists.
- **Play** (speaker icon) — disabled until the audio has been generated. Toggles between play and pause; the icon updates accordingly.

File names are a hash of *text + voice + model + instructions*, so:
- Identical passages with the same settings reuse the same audio file (no re-billing).
- Changing voice, model, or instructions produces a new file; the old one stays on disk.

### Enabling and configuring TTS

In module settings, scroll to the TTS section and:

1. Toggle **Enable Read-Aloud TTS**.
2. Optionally set **TTS API Endpoint** and **TTS API Key** — leave them empty to reuse the translation endpoint/key.
3. Pick a **TTS Model** (`tts-1`, `tts-1-hd`, or the steerable `gpt-4o-mini-tts`).
4. Pick a **TTS Voice** (alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, fable, onyx, nova, sage, shimmer, verse).
5. Optionally fill **TTS Voice Instructions** with a free-form style prompt (only honored by `gpt-4o-mini-tts`), for example:

   ```
   Italian Dungeon Master narrating a tabletop RPG boxed text. Slow, measured pacing,
   warm but ominous tone. Native Italian accent. Treat punctuation as breath.
   Avoid English intonation, theatrical over-acting, and sound effects.
   ```

6. Optionally change **TTS Audio Folder** if you prefer a different location inside `Data/`.

> The **Generate** button requires GM permissions (Foundry blocks file uploads from players). Once the file exists on disk, any connected client can press Play.

## Options

- **Minimum Role to Translate** (Game Master by default) controls who sees the Translate button. Translating spends the API key configured for the world, so lowering this lets those users spend it too.
- **Output Mode**: choose what happens with the translated text:
  - **Replace the original text** (default): overwrites the description in place, as before.
  - **Create a translated copy**: leaves the original untouched and creates a copy with the target language appended to its name (items are created in the same folder, journal pages inside the same journal entry).
  - **Append / Prepend translation**: keeps both texts in the same description, separated by a horizontal rule.
- **Custom Prompt**: write your translation prompt directly in module settings. When not empty, it takes precedence over the prompt template file. Useful for iterating on translation style without leaving Foundry.
- **Prompt Template File**: select a text file containing your prompt. Used only when the custom prompt is empty.
- If you would like to use the default prompt, leave both the custom prompt and the prompt file selection empty.
- The default prompt asks the model to keep the HTML structure, the game terms and the Foundry reference syntax (`@UUID`, `@Check`, `@Damage`, `&Reference`, inline rolls) untouched. A custom prompt or a prompt file replaces the default entirely, so repeat those instructions in your own prompt if you rely on them.
- **Cache Translations Locally** (on by default) reuses a previous translation instead of calling the API when the same text is translated again.
  - The cache lives in your browser only. It is not shared with other players, other browsers, or the world database.
  - Entries are keyed by prompt + model + endpoint, so changing the prompt, language, game system, model, or endpoint produces new entries rather than serving a stale translation.
  - It holds at most 300 entries; the oldest are dropped first.
  - Use the **Clear Cache** button next to the setting to discard everything cached in this browser.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feature development will be slow and based on community interest. For personal use, the module is already sufficient.
